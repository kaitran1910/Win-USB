# Bootable Windows USB for MacOS users

Simply double-click the "installer" file and follow the instructions.

If you are prompted *"installer" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer...*, simply Right-Click and select "Open".

To force quit the installer, simply press Command + Q.

## Pre-requisites

 - Using MacOS (Linux might work too, but I haven't tested it)
 - A USB drive with at least 8GB of space
 - A Windows ISO (see below)

## Steps:
 - Download the Windows ISO from Microsoft
 - Make sure the name is "Win10_22H2_English_x64.iso" (change the name if it's different)
 - Make sure the ISO is in the Downloads folder

 ## TODO:
 - Add support for other Windows ISOs
 - Catch errors and display them to the user
